we just make an array of items and set all their stats then the store references all the array of items showing the image and stats, etc. If I add new items should just have to create it and everything else should work with it except maybe special ability.

1 ad - infinity edge
bf sword, pickaxe, cloak of agility
1 ap - morrello
blasting wand, oblivion orb, amplifying tome, ruby crystal
1 attack speed - phantom dancer
brawlers gloves, dagger, zeal
1 mr - spirit visage
spectres cowl kindlegem, ruby crystal,  null-mantle
1 armor - randuin
giants belt, ruby crystal, cloth armor, wardens mail
1 heal - warmog
giant belt, kindlegem, crystalline bracer, rejuve bead, ruby cyrstal
boots

each item holds what it needs to make it at the top level then we recursively call it down
