rendering will just be images, probably just take images from league or something
map will probably be like a one lane thing with some camps maybe just copy middle lane of real map
maybe 4 champions, darius, ashe,

physics will be 2d with all polygons I can just use line physics tho like i did in engine
or could pick 4 corner points of player and see if those points are inside polygon.

minions will be coded, towers, jungle camps, minimap, clicking and shortest path, combat, some items
will not be fps dependant it will time dependant and you can set fps
this should be clean, organized code using generalites throughout to make easy
