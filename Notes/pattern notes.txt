for champions and abilities use subclass sandbox, one parent class with functions like move, playsound, spawnparticle, that all the others have to use within its 1 sandbox function

for game loop stuff probably group minions and jungle monster into entity class

player input use command break commands into classes and pass around objects

state for enemies, and towers, and maybe player
