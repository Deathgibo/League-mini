player will have the playerabilities class that will handle all input and ability stuff it just needs to call it on update.

the ability class will do the stuff and probably even hold variables to not clutter player

the player will also have a state thing as well but just for stuns and silences and death
so the player will have a state that does nothing, than a state if hes stunned, a state if hes dead, etc
